# Hello-GitHub
Just start to know github.
Now senior student in SJTU, Agriculture and Biology Institute, majoring in Food Science and Engineering.
I spent 3 years to find that, I don't like it at all.
It was the end of the 3rd years, one of my friends invited me to team up and take part in MCM/ACM.
After participating in MCM/ICM as programmer(And the modeling work was also leaded by me indeed), I found what I want.

At least I won't waste my time in vain like what I did before.
